# Supermarket-Sales
Python and Pandas Exploratory Data Supermarket Sales
## Introduction
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using external python packages such as: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn on a supermarket sales dataset. After the intial data exploration, univariate and bivariate analysis was performed. A correlation analysis was also done at the end.
## Procedure
Our first step was to import all the needed libraries; Pandas for data manipulation, numpy for scientific computing, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Import dataset and take a look at the first five rows, the column names, and the datatypes of each column. We fixed the datatype of column 'Date' and made it our index. Ran a quick summary statistics. A quick search for duplicates and missing values was conducted and at the end a correlation matrix performed as well as a visual.
## Findings
Based on the Distribution Plot of Customer Rating we can see the data for customer ratings is equally distributed. Aggregate sale numbers do not differ between the different branches, there also isn't much difference between the different payment methods. After plotting a scatterplot with a trend line with customer ratings and gross income, we can conclude there is not relation between the two variables. Gross income does not influence customer ratings. The relationship between branch and gross income was explored and there was no variation between the two. When comparing gender and gross income, no variation was seen either. After using a line graph to plot a time trend of gross income there seems to be no trend
